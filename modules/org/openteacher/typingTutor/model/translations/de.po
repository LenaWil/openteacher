"Welcome, I'm your personal OpenTeacher typing tutor. We'll improve your "
"typing skills by doing simple exercises. Between the exercises, I'll give "
"instructions. Let's get started:\n"
"\n"
"First place your fingers on the so-called home row: your fingers, from left "
"to right, should always be on the keys '{a}', '{s}', '{d}', '{f}', "
"'{space}', '{space}', '{j}', '{k}', '{l}' and '{;}' while not typing another "
"character. When your fingers are in position, press {space} to start the "
"first lesson. Work for accuracy at first, not speed."
