"Welcome, I'm your personal OpenTeacher typing tutor. We'll improve your "
"typing skills by doing simple exercises. Between the exercises, I'll give "
"instructions. Let's get started:\n"
"\n"
"First place your fingers on the so-called home row: your fingers, from left "
"to right, should always be on the keys '{a}', '{s}', '{d}', '{f}', "
"'{space}', '{space}', '{j}', '{k}', '{l}' and '{;}' while not typing another "
"character. When your fingers are in position, press {space} to start the "
"first lesson. Work for accuracy at first, not speed."

"歡迎，我是您個人的 OpenTeacher 打字助教。我們將會做一些簡單練習來增進您的打字技巧。在練習過程中，我會給您指令。讓我們開始吧：\n"

"'{a}','{s}','{d}','{f}','{space}','{space}','{j}','{k}','{l}' 和 '{;}' "
"上面。當您的手指就位後，按 {space} 來開始第一課。首先要注意的是準確性，而不是速度。"
